                        We generally avoid fish/mutton in hotels so not much comments about those here.

                            For a westerner, the food served on banana leaf was a nice touch. Only thing I personally didn't like,
                             was the "brain fry" I tried, but what do you expect, the food was great.

                             They know what they’re doing and what they’re talking about, and you can tell making the customers happy
                              is their main priority. Food is pretty good, some chinese classics and some twists, and for their prices
                               it’s 100% worth it.</div>
